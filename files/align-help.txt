::Align.bat
An alignment wizard for cmd console window | by Sounak@9434
Have you ever wanted to have a text echoed at the right side of the screen?
Or to have a center-align feature like in Microsoft word?
In that case this is the right tool for you

::Usage
>>>Print Help File
	call align.bat /?
	[requires help.txt to be in the same directory]
>>>Basic Usage
	call align.bat [/m|/r] "TEXT"
>>>Output to a Variable
	call align.bat [/m|/r] "TEXT" var

Align.bat sets the window size the first time it runs to speed up calculations
for future. If window size is manually changed you have to run align.bat with
a /s switch which will reset the window size.

>>>Set window size(once again)
	call align.bat /s

Calling align.bat with an additional /s switch sets up the columns value again.
So till you Change the screen size again you don't need to use an /s switch
I don't think any update is needed but if you want a special feature just mail 
me at 'www.sounak9434@gmail.com'.
